# Ski Resort Ticket Pricing Model

This is a guided capstone project that successfully developed a predictive model as a part of a ticket pricing strategy for a fictional ski resort, Big Mountain Ski Resort, using the entire Data Science life cycle from problem definition to data wrangling and exploration to modelling and prediction and finally, presentation of findings. 

The project resulted in an increased ‘Adult Weekend’ ticket price by ~15$/ticket and an additional ~$5.2MM/yr in annual revenue, by successfully developing a Linear Regression and Random Forest model with Grid Search cross-validation for effective hyperparameter tuning and pipelines for preprocessing steps.

Appropriate metrics such as MAE were used for scoring model performance and final model selection.

Lastly, key insights from the model's predictions were presented in a digestible format for easy communication with non-technical stakeholders.
